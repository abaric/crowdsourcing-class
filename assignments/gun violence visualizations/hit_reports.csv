1937395359,N,Yes,N,N,N,N,N,No,N,Yes,No,N,Yes,Yes,N,No,No,Yes,Yes,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"<p>(ABC News)  Adam Lanza killed himself. So did Seung-Hui Cho at Virginia Tech. And so did Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in Columbine. And Christopher Harper-Mercer in Roseburg. And Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista.</p> <p>If you go down the list of mass shootings at U.S. schools, most of the killers turned the guns on themselves after killing classmates and teachers. Several others were killed by police, and a few were taken into custody alive.</p> <p>But only two are now out of prison, one of whom was arrested with a gun after his release, while the other has since applied for a concealed carry permit.</p> <p>Not only that, but because Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden were minors at the time of the 1998 shooting  13 and 11, respectively  when they killed five people in what was then the second-deadliest U.S. school shooting, Arkansas state law mandated that they be released on their 21st birthdays, with their records sealed.</p> <p>Little has been reported about the lives of Golden and Johnson since they were released in the mid-2000s, but they seem to have one thing in common: neither apparently swore off guns after their time in juvenile detention.</p> <p>THE DAY TWO BOYS BECAME MASS SHOOTERS</p> <p>Debbie Spencer was a science teacher at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, in 1998 and taught both Golden and Johnson. She said Johnson was one of the most polite students Ive ever had. Always Yes, maam, no maam,' she told ABC.</p> <p>On the other hand, she said, Golden was sneaky.</p> <p>He would do enough to get by. I remember the conversation we had the day before [the shooting]. I was going over to see if they wanted to know what their grades were so far, Spencer said, remembering that Golden had just barely gotten a B.</p> <p>You just got by by the skin of your teeth, didnt you? she recalled saying to him.</p> <p>And he said, Yup, I always do,' she said.</p> <p>It gives me chills because he knew what he was going to do at this point, she said.</p> <p>The two were reportedly planning a shooting and getaway, with news reports at the time detailing how Johnson took his parents car and the boys broke into Goldens grandparents home where his grandfather kept his guns unlocked. One of the pair then pulled the fire alarm at lunch and opened fire when people started to flee.</p> <p>They were hiding in bushes and shooting at us, Spencer said. We didnt know what was going on. It was an ambush. It was chaos.</p> <p>I didnt even know it was that close to me until I was giving the police my statement and I saw, Oh look, theres a hole in my purse,' she said.</p> <p>Jonesboro was tied for the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history at the time, according to an ABC News analysis of FBI records.</p> <p>Part of the reason it is not as well remembered today stems from a matter of timing, one expert says. Golden and Johnson didnt know it when they pulled their respective triggers, but little over a year later, a pair of teenage boys was going to open fire at their Colorado school in a horrific, deadly event that unfolded on live TV in .</p> <p>Journalist Dave Cullen spent nearly 10 years writing a book about that shooting at Columbine High School, and said the Jonesboro shooting and others contributed to Columbines resonance.</p> <p>There had been the lead up to [Columbine] and the growing anxiety in the country about these school shootings, Cullen told ABC News. If you had had Columbine out of the blue, it would have been horrifying but it would have seemed unique it would seem more like a one off. The fact that it felt like part of a pattern is what made it much worse  a pattern but taken to an extreme, way beyond our imagination.</p> <p>In the subsequent 18 years after Jonesboro, the Westside Middle School shooting was knocked down from being tied for second to being locked in a five-way tie for ninth deadliest shooting in the nation, the ABC News analysis concludes.</p> <p>Golden and Johnson are the only two U.S. mass school shooters from the past century who are alive and not incarcerated.</p> <p>THE JUSTICE OF JUVENILES</p> <p>In most mass killings, which the FBI defines as any incident in which three or more people are killed, the offenders put on trial are convicted of at least one charge of felony murder. Felons are barred from possessing firearms.</p> <p>But in the case of the Westside Middle School shooters, they were tried as juveniles, which means they were technically found delinquent instead of guilty, and even though they served time, they came out with sealed records.</p> <p>Back on March 24, 1998, the pair got guns from Goldens grandfathers house, went to school, pulled the fire alarm after lunch and stood outside the door where they knew students would be fleeing. They opened fire, killing four students and a teacher, and injuring 10 others.</p> <p>Less than 10 years later, both young men were free.</p> <p>The decision to charge the pair as juveniles was not really a decision at all, but the only option: At the time, Arkansas did not allow juveniles to be tried as adults. That law was changed a year after this case, the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research said.</p> <p>Many specifics of their story after they were sentenced are hard to pin down because of state laws that protect both juvenile offenders and gun owners, or would-be owners. In Arkansas, the majority of juvenile cases are sealed, a Craighead County Court official told ABC News, so both court officials and lawyers involved with the cases are not only barred from revealing the details of the case but also from acknowledging the existence  or non-existence  of those cases in the first place.</p> <p>According to John Smith, the chief deputy clerk for the Craighead County Circuit Court, there is a good chance Golden and Johnsons court records had been destroyed, and after a week of searching, he could not find the physical copies.</p> <p>GUN POSSESSION AND FREEDOM</p> <p>Arkansas also has a law that prevents anyone in the state police department from confirming the status of any conceal carry permit application, or the names of individuals who have or have not applied or were rejected. The law is relatively new, coming into effect in 2009, the Bureau of Legislative Research confirmed.</p> <p>Before the law changed, however, Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler had confirmed to The Arkansas Times, based on the fingerprint needed to apply, that Golden had applied for the conceal carry permit in 2008 using the name Drew Douglas Grant. When ABC News asked this week, Sadler declined to comment because of the new law, but he did explain that sealed records show up in law enforcement background checks though not civilian ones like employer background checks.</p> <p>According to The Arkansas Times account, when Drew Douglas Grant applied for a concealed handgun carry license, he listed an address in Arkansas, about 70 miles northwest of Jonesboro. The paper reported that his application was denied because at least one answer  his address history  was proved false after not listing the juvenile detention facility or subsequent federal detention facility where he had lived for several years.</p> <p>Even though he could only speak in hypotheticals given the legal restrictions, Sadler said he was not surprised that Golden, by any name, would be rejected.</p> <p>When you commit a crime such as the one that was committed at Westside Middle School, and even if you change your name from what your name was at the time of the crime, you cant escape what the clerks knew, Sadler said of the clerks tasked with approving or denying conceal carry permits.</p> <p>Anybody whos changed their name, you cant change your fingerprints, he said.</p> <p>Sadler said state law does not require an individual to register the specific handgun the applicant intends to conceal, and gun ownership is technically not a requirement for applicants. As a result, there is no way of checking whether Golden owned a gun. Sadler did not respond to the question of why someone would apply for a concealed carry license without owning or having ready access to a gun.</p> <p>As for Johnson, his obtaining a firearm at some point after his release is not up for debate. After a traffic stop in Arkansas in 2007, he was arrested for possessing a firearm in the presence of a controlled substance. The lawyer who represented him in that case, Jack Schisler, told ABC News that in more than 20 years of practicing law, he has never seen that charge used. When asked why that particular charge was used, Schisler said: Because hes Mitchell Johnson, Jonesboro school shooter. Thats my opinion.</p> <p>They were looking at the fact that because he was a juvenile when he got involved in the Jonesboro school shooting and, essentially, got out when he was 21 years old, that didnt sit well with a lot of people. And I think they thought this would be probably the most powerful charge, Schisler said.</p> <p>While out on bond for that case, Johnson was arrested again in 2008. The Associated Press reported that Johnson admitted to taking a debit card left by a customer at the Arkansas gas station where Johnson was working. Johnson proceeded to use the card at the gas station and at a fast food restaurant, and had marijuana on his person at the time of his arrest.</p> <p>Johnson was sentenced to 12 years after being convicted in that 2008 incident and would be eligible for parole in 2011, but then faced four more years for the earlier drug and weapons conviction from the traffic stop, the AP reported. Schisler confirmed the account. Court records show that he was released in July 2015 into the custody of the U.S. Probation Office for the Southern District of Texas and placed in a drug rehabilitation program. There office did not respond to ABC News multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT</p> <p>Photos of Golden, who may or may not still go by his changed name, were released at the time of the shooting. His 11-year-old mug shot comes up readily in Internet searches.</p> <p>ABC News contacted 10 phone numbers listed for various relatives of Golden. His grandmother declined to comment and three of his previous lawyers told ABC News that they had not spoken to him in years and did not have any way to contact him. Johnsons mother declined to comment when contacted and Johnsons father said that they have been estranged for years and he has no idea where his son is now.</p> <p>Spencer had said that there had been speculation in Jonesboro that Golden started attending a local university after his release in May 2007. The registrar for the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville, which is about 60 miles west of Westside, confirmed to ABC News that an individual named Drew D. Grant attended the school from August 2007 until December 2009.</p> <p>Johnson has a more recent mug shot floating around as a result of his subsequent arrests. On top of that, he was subject to a videotaped deposition in 2007 as part of the civil suit filed on behalf of the relatives of the victims. That taped deposition was released publicly, along with the transcript, but that wasnt the case with Golden.</p> <p>Danny Glover represents Golden in the civil suit filed against the pair by the relatives of the victims. Glover told ABC News that while the suit is still open, its just been sitting there for decades  well, at least one decade.</p> <p>The Craighead County Circuit Court clerk told ABC News that the latest action in the suit came in 2013 when Goldens grandfather was removed as a defendant in the suit because he died in 2012. When ABC News contacted Bobby McDaniel, the lawyer representing the victims relatives in the suit to ask what was stalling the suit, he said it was the fact that Johnson was still in jail.</p> <p>When told that Johnson was released in July, McDaniel said that he intends to get a trial date so that we can obtain a moneyed judgment against both defendants for both compensatory and punitive damages. Punitive damages cannot be set aside in bankruptcy. I do not expect to collect these judgments but I want them hanging over their heads.</p> <p>Glover confirmed that Golden was deposed as part of that suit but it was sealed by court order because it had personal information about his whereabouts and identity that the court felt didnt need to be disclosed for his protection.</p> <p>After the release of Johnsons deposition, Glover said Johnson received death threats.</p> <p>[Golden] changed his name at some point, so the court prevented the dissemination of that information and that was part of the court order, Glover said of Golden.</p> <p>By contrast, in Arkansas, sex offenders are required to update the state either twice or four times a year with their addresses, vehicle information, physical characteristics, place of work, identifying codes for all of their electronic devices, and all of their email accounts and user names, according to Brad Cazort, the administrator of the repository division of the Arkansas Crime Information Center.</p> <p>I am very critical that our judicial system will allow mass murderers to live anywhere they want without their identities being known, their crimes known, or the families in those areas to be aware of who is living near them, McDaniel told ABC.</p> <p>Both McDaniel and Mitch Wright, the husband of Westside teacher Shannon Wright, who was fatally shot in the back, say they believe the restrictions placed on these criminals pale in comparison to offenders who have not committed murder.</p> <p>I think that if a sex offender has to register as a sex offender, then I believe a person thats able to commit the crimes that were as bad as these were then yes I do believe its in the publics interest to know the name that he is going by, Wright, 50, told ABC News of Golden.</p> <p>The privacy awarded the shooters because of their ages is understood but not appreciated by some.

I think he regrets what happened and really cant explain what happened. Of course, he was 11 when it happened At 11, its hard to imagine why somebody would do that.</p> <p>The public defender who represented Golden in the original juvenile case in state circuit court, Val Price, had no comment when asked by ABC News to describe Golden.</p> <p>Wright, who was left to raise their toddler after his 32-year-old wifes death, said he wishes Golden and Johnson were still behind bars, but I have reached a point in my life where its in Gods hands.</p> <p>Heres how I raised my son: He was two and a half and I could have raised my son in a home filled with hate and anger, and I could have let that hate and anger destroy him and me and destroy our souls, and that could have prevented us from ever seeing her again, Wright said.</p> <p>And what I told him was this: these two boys could truly repent and they can be forgiven for their sins and they could go to heaven and we could go to hell if we let this hate and anger eat us alive.</p> <p>Spencer said that the search for answers used to drive me crazy. The year after the shooting was the hardest, and not just because of timing but because she had Johnsons younger brother in her class that year.</p> <p>When his mother came for a parent-teacher conference, I just point-blank asked her.

Spencer told ABC.</p> <p>She said that Mitchell said that Andrew told Mitchell to shoot all the teachers, Spencer said.</p> <p>While Johnsons mother declined to comment for this story, she did apologize as part of a town hall special ABC News hosted in 1999.

So did Seung-Hui Cho at Virginia Tech. And so did Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in Columbine. And Christopher Harper-Mercer in Roseburg. And Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista.</p> <p>If you go down the list of mass shootings at U.S. schools, most of the killers turned the guns on themselves after killing classmates and teachers. Several others were killed by police, and a few were taken into custody alive.</p> <p>But only two are now out of prison, one of whom was arrested with a gun after his release, while the other has since applied for a concealed carry permit.</p> <p>Not only that, but because Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden were minors at the time of the 1998 shooting  13 and 11, respectively  when they killed five people in what was then the second-deadliest U.S. school shooting, Arkansas state law mandated that they be released on their 21st birthdays, with their records sealed.</p> <p>Little has been reported about the lives of Golden and Johnson since they were released in the mid-2000s, but they seem to have one thing in common: neither apparently swore off guns after their time in juvenile detention.</p> <p>THE DAY TWO BOYS BECAME MASS SHOOTERS</p> <p>Debbie Spencer was a science teacher at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, in 1998 and taught both Golden and Johnson. She said Johnson was one of the most polite students Ive ever had. Always Yes, maam, no maam,' she told ABC.</p> <p>On the other hand, she said, Golden was sneaky.</p> <p>He would do enough to get by. I remember the conversation we had the day before [the shooting]. I was going over to see if they wanted to know what their grades were so far, Spencer said, remembering that Golden had just barely gotten a B.</p> <p>You just got by by the skin of your teeth, didnt you? she recalled saying to him.</p> <p>And he said, Yup, I always do,' she said.</p> <p>It gives me chills because he knew what he was going to do at this point, she said.</p> <p>The two were reportedly planning a shooting and getaway, with news reports at the time detailing how Johnson took his parents car and the boys broke into Goldens grandparents home where his grandfather kept his guns unlocked. One of the pair then pulled the fire alarm at lunch and opened fire when people started to flee.</p> <p>They were hiding in bushes and shooting at us, Spencer said. We didnt know what was going on. It was an ambush. It was chaos.</p> <p>I didnt even know it was that close to me until I was giving the police my statement and I saw, Oh look, theres a hole in my purse,' she said.</p> <p>Jonesboro was tied for the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history at the time, according to an ABC News analysis of FBI records.</p> <p>Part of the reason it is not as well remembered today stems from a matter of timing, one expert says. Golden and Johnson didnt know it when they pulled their respective triggers, but little over a year later, a pair of teenage boys was going to open fire at their Colorado school in a horrific, deadly event that unfolded on live TV in .</p> <p>Journalist Dave Cullen spent nearly 10 years writing a book about that shooting at Columbine High School, and said the Jonesboro shooting and others contributed to Columbines resonance.</p> <p>There had been the lead up to [Columbine] and the growing anxiety in the country about these school shootings, Cullen told ABC News. If you had had Columbine out of the blue, it would have been horrifying but it would have seemed unique it would seem more like a one off. The fact that it felt like part of a pattern is what made it much worse  a pattern but taken to an extreme, way beyond our imagination.</p> <p>In the subsequent 18 years after Jonesboro, the Westside Middle School shooting was knocked down from being tied for second to being locked in a five-way tie for ninth deadliest shooting in the nation, the ABC News analysis concludes.</p> <p>Golden and Johnson are the only two U.S. mass school shooters from the past century who are alive and not incarcerated.</p> <p>THE JUSTICE OF JUVENILES</p> <p>In most mass killings, which the FBI defines as any incident in which three or more people are killed, the offenders put on trial are convicted of at least one charge of felony murder. Felons are barred from possessing firearms.</p> <p>But in the case of the Westside Middle School shooters, they were tried as juveniles, which means they were technically found delinquent instead of guilty, and even though they served time, they came out with sealed records.</p> <p>Back on March 24, 1998, the pair got guns from Goldens grandfathers house, went to school, pulled the fire alarm after lunch and stood outside the door where they knew students would be fleeing. They opened fire, killing four students and a teacher, and injuring 10 others.</p> <p>Less than 10 years later, both young men were free.</p> <p>The decision to charge the pair as juveniles was not really a decision at all, but the only option: At the time, Arkansas did not allow juveniles to be tried as adults. That law was changed a year after this case, the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research said.</p> <p>Many specifics of their story after they were sentenced are hard to pin down because of state laws that protect both juvenile offenders and gun owners, or would-be owners. In Arkansas, the majority of juvenile cases are sealed, a Craighead County Court official told ABC News, so both court officials and lawyers involved with the cases are not only barred from revealing the details of the case but also from acknowledging the existence  or non-existence  of those cases in the first place.</p> <p>According to John Smith, the chief deputy clerk for the Craighead County Circuit Court, there is a good chance Golden and Johnsons court records had been destroyed, and after a week of searching, he could not find the physical copies.</p> <p>GUN POSSESSION AND FREEDOM</p> <p>Arkansas also has a law that prevents anyone in the state police department from confirming the status of any conceal carry permit application, or the names of individuals who have or have not applied or were rejected. The law is relatively new, coming into effect in 2009, the Bureau of Legislative Research confirmed.</p> <p>Before the law changed, however, Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler had confirmed to The Arkansas Times, based on the fingerprint needed to apply, that Golden had applied for the conceal carry permit in 2008 using the name Drew Douglas Grant. When ABC News asked this week, Sadler declined to comment because of the new law, but he did explain that sealed records show up in law enforcement background checks though not civilian ones like employer background checks.</p> <p>According to The Arkansas Times account, when Drew Douglas Grant applied for a concealed handgun carry license, he listed an address in Arkansas, about 70 miles northwest of Jonesboro. The paper reported that his application was denied because at least one answer  his address history  was proved false after not listing the juvenile detention facility or subsequent federal detention facility where he had lived for several years.</p> <p>Even though he could only speak in hypotheticals given the legal restrictions, Sadler said he was not surprised that Golden, by any name, would be rejected.</p> <p>When you commit a crime such as the one that was committed at Westside Middle School, and even if you change your name from what your name was at the time of the crime, you cant escape what the clerks knew, Sadler said of the clerks tasked with approving or denying conceal carry permits.</p> <p>Anybody whos changed their name, you cant change your fingerprints, he said.</p> <p>Sadler said state law does not require an individual to register the specific handgun the applicant intends to conceal, and gun ownership is technically not a requirement for applicants. As a result, there is no way of checking whether Golden owned a gun. Sadler did not respond to the question of why someone would apply for a concealed carry license without owning or having ready access to a gun.</p> <p>As for Johnson, his obtaining a firearm at some point after his release is not up for debate. After a traffic stop in Arkansas in 2007, he was arrested for possessing a firearm in the presence of a controlled substance. The lawyer who represented him in that case, Jack Schisler, told ABC News that in more than 20 years of practicing law, he has never seen that charge used. When asked why that particular charge was used, Schisler said: Because hes Mitchell Johnson, Jonesboro school shooter. Thats my opinion.</p> <p>They were looking at the fact that because he was a juvenile when he got involved in the Jonesboro school shooting and, essentially, got out when he was 21 years old, that didnt sit well with a lot of people. And I think they thought this would be probably the most powerful charge, Schisler said.</p> <p>While out on bond for that case, Johnson was arrested again in 2008. The Associated Press reported that Johnson admitted to taking a debit card left by a customer at the Arkansas gas station where Johnson was working. Johnson proceeded to use the card at the gas station and at a fast food restaurant, and had marijuana on his person at the time of his arrest.</p> <p>Johnson was sentenced to 12 years after being convicted in that 2008 incident and would be eligible for parole in 2011, but then faced four more years for the earlier drug and weapons conviction from the traffic stop, the AP reported. Schisler confirmed the account. Court records show that he was released in July 2015 into the custody of the U.S. Probation Office for the Southern District of Texas and placed in a drug rehabilitation program. There office did not respond to ABC News multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT</p> <p>Photos of Golden, who may or may not still go by his changed name, were released at the time of the shooting. His 11-year-old mug shot comes up readily in Internet searches.</p> <p>ABC News contacted 10 phone numbers listed for various relatives of Golden. His grandmother declined to comment and three of his previous lawyers told ABC News that they had not spoken to him in years and did not have any way to contact him. Johnsons mother declined to comment when contacted and Johnsons father said that they have been estranged for years and he has no idea where his son is now.</p> <p>Spencer had said that there had been speculation in Jonesboro that Golden started attending a local university after his release in May 2007. The registrar for the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville, which is about 60 miles west of Westside, confirmed to ABC News that an individual named Drew D. Grant attended the school from August 2007 until December 2009.</p> <p>Johnson has a more recent mug shot floating around as a result of his subsequent arrests. On top of that, he was subject to a videotaped deposition in 2007 as part of the civil suit filed on behalf of the relatives of the victims. That taped deposition was released publicly, along with the transcript, but that wasnt the case with Golden.</p> <p>Danny Glover represents Golden in the civil suit filed against the pair by the relatives of the victims. Glover told ABC News that while the suit is still open, its just been sitting there for decades  well, at least one decade.</p> <p>The Craighead County Circuit Court clerk told ABC News that the latest action in the suit came in 2013 when Goldens grandfather was removed as a defendant in the suit because he died in 2012. When ABC News contacted Bobby McDaniel, the lawyer representing the victims relatives in the suit to ask what was stalling the suit, he said it was the fact that Johnson was still in jail.</p> <p>When told that Johnson was released in July, McDaniel said that he intends to get a trial date so that we can obtain a moneyed judgment against both defendants for both compensatory and punitive damages. Punitive damages cannot be set aside in bankruptcy. I do not expect to collect these judgments but I want them hanging over their heads.</p> <p>Glover confirmed that Golden was deposed as part of that suit but it was sealed by court order because it had personal information about his whereabouts and identity that the court felt didnt need to be disclosed for his protection.</p> <p>After the release of Johnsons deposition, Glover said Johnson received death threats.</p> <p>[Golden] changed his name at some point, so the court prevented the dissemination of that information and that was part of the court order, Glover said of Golden.</p> <p>By contrast, in Arkansas, sex offenders are required to update the state either twice or four times a year with their addresses, vehicle information, physical characteristics, place of work, identifying codes for all of their electronic devices, and all of their email accounts and user names, according to Brad Cazort, the administrator of the repository division of the Arkansas Crime Information Center.</p> <p>I am very critical that our judicial system will allow mass murderers to live anywhere they want without their identities being known, their crimes known, or the families in those areas to be aware of who is living near them, McDaniel told ABC.</p> <p>Both McDaniel and Mitch Wright, the husband of Westside teacher Shannon Wright, who was fatally shot in the back, say they believe the restrictions placed on these criminals pale in comparison to offenders who have not committed murder.</p> <p>I think that if a sex offender has to register as a sex offender, then I believe a person thats able to commit the crimes that were as bad as these were then yes I do believe its in the publics interest to know the name that he is going by, Wright, 50, told ABC News of Golden.</p> <p>The privacy awarded the shooters because of their ages is understood but not appreciated by some. Spencer, the science teacher, said it seemed uneven that they [the shooters] could find anything out they wanted to about us but Golden and Johnson are protected.</p> <p>They shouldnt have any rights. They shouldnt have the right to be out, to get a family, to have a gun and have a normal life like they didnt ever do anything wrong, she said.</p> <p>Brandi Varner, whose 11-year-old sister Britthney was killed in the shooting, said that every time of year around this time is a slap in the face because she is reminded of the anniversary and that her sisters shooters are free.</p> <p>This guy is living the life that your sister dreamed of, said Varner, now 31, who was 14 at the time of the shooting.</p> <p>SEARCH FOR ANSWERS</p> <p>Videotaped confessions or manifestos released online have given subsequent shooters outlets to explain themselves and their actions, but such clarity was never available in the case of Jonesboro.</p> <p>I think [the deposition was] a matter of getting answers, Glover said.

It documents the Oct. 20, 2014 killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who police said was holding a small knife when he was fatally shot by a police officer.</p> <p>For months, city officials had declined to release the video, citing an ongoing federal grand jury probe of the incident. Police say that McDonald, who had PCP in his system at the time of his death and refused to drop the knife, had been acting erratically before the police officer opened fire.</p> <p>Police had started their pursuit of McDonald after receiving a 911 call from someone who said that a knife-wielding man had threatened him and appeared to be trying to break into cars.</p> <p>A union official suggested to reporters soon after the incident that the officer was acting in self-defense. McDonald's family attorneys and some witness, however, said that the teen was walking away from the police officer when he was shot. Five other police officers at the scene did not fire their weapons.</p> <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the city would not file an appeal of Valderrama's ruling and would release the video by Wednesday. He said that he hoped prosecutors would wrap up their investigation by then, noting ""it appears an officer violated"" the public trust.</p> <p>""The city's Independent Police Review Authority promptly sent this case and the evidence to state and federal prosecutors who have been investigating it for almost a year,"" Emanuel said in a statement. ""In accordance with the judge's ruling the city will release the video by November 25, which we hope will provide prosecutors time to expeditiously bring their investigation to a conclusion so Chicago can begin to heal.""</p> <p>The incident happened about two months after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., by a white police officer ignited nationwide protests.</p> <p>McDonald's family has said through their attorneys that they worry that release of the potentially inflammatory video could unleash unrest in Chicago. McDonald is black and the police officer who shot him is white.</p> <p>""What's important is that the community be told the truth about what happened, about how he was shot,"" said Michael Robbins, an attorney for the McDonald family. ""There was a narrative put out there by the Chicago police, by the union initially, that a police officer had to shoot him in self defense...that he lunged at a police officer with a knife. It's not true. He was shot while he was walking away.""</p> <p>Chicago's city council voted in April to pay McDonald's family $5 million. As part of the settlement, a judge barred attorneys from releasing the video footage.</p> <p>Thursday's decision was triggered by a lawsuit brought by Brandon Smith, an independent journalist, who had a Freedom of Information Act request for the video denied in May.</p> <p>No charges have been filed against the police officer.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the office of the Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan delivered an opinion that the Chicago Police Department violated the state Freedom of Information law, when it denied a separate open records request made by a Wall Street Journal reporter for the dashcam video.</p> <p>""We expected this ruling, we're glad for this ruling,"" said Matt Topic, an attorney for the journalist Smith, after the judge issued his ruling. ""The Illinois Attorney General has ruled on this, the court has now ruled on this. It's time for the city to release this video and not continue this fight.""</p>","http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2015/11/19/judge-rules-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-chicago-police-department-video/76050354/ "

Five other police officers at the scene did not fire their weapons.</p> <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the city would not file an appeal of Valderrama's ruling and would release the video by Wednesday. He said that he hoped prosecutors would wrap up their investigation by then, noting ""it appears an officer violated"" the public trust.</p> <p>""The city's Independent Police Review Authority promptly sent this case and the evidence to state and federal prosecutors who have been investigating it for almost a year,"" Emanuel said in a statement. ""In accordance with the judge's ruling the city will release the video by November 25, which we hope will provide prosecutors time to expeditiously bring their investigation to a conclusion so Chicago can begin to heal.""</p> <p>The incident happened about two months after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., by a white police officer ignited nationwide protests.</p> <p>McDonald's family has said through their attorneys that they worry that release of the potentially inflammatory video could unleash unrest in Chicago. McDonald is black and the police officer who shot him is white.</p> <p>""What's important is that the community be told the truth about what happened, about how he was shot,"" said Michael Robbins, an attorney for the McDonald family. ""There was a narrative put out there by the Chicago police, by the union initially, that a police officer had to shoot him in self defense...that he lunged at a police officer with a knife. It's not true. He was shot while he was walking away.""</p> <p>Chicago's city council voted in April to pay McDonald's family $5 million. As part of the settlement, a judge barred attorneys from releasing the video footage.</p> <p>Thursday's decision was triggered by a lawsuit brought by Brandon Smith, an independent journalist, who had a Freedom of Information Act request for the video denied in May.</p> <p>No charges have been filed against the police officer.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the office of the Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan delivered an opinion that the Chicago Police Department violated the state Freedom of Information law, when it denied a separate open records request made by a Wall Street Journal reporter for the dashcam video.</p> <p>""We expected this ruling, we're glad for this ruling,"" said Matt Topic, an attorney for the journalist Smith, after the judge issued his ruling. ""The Illinois Attorney General has ruled on this, the court has now ruled on this. It's time for the city to release this video and not continue this fight.""</p>","http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2015/11/19/judge-rules-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-chicago-police-department-video/76050354/ "

Calvin Williams told dozens of mourners as he officiated a funeral service at St. Luke's Community Christian Church in Chester. ""It's bad enough that our kids are killing each other, but now, we're just like Florida, Baltimore, we're like New York.""</p> <p>Longer, 33, was killed this month after an early-morning police chase that ended when he crashed his SUV in a Chester neighborhood. Longer, who had vowed to his passenger that he would not return to prison, then allegedly pointed a loaded gun at police, and officers opened fire.</p> <p>Police fired nearly 100 shots. Longer never fired his weapon.

White later confirmed that he opened fire on Abdulazeez, who was later shot and killed by police after he had already killed four Marines and one sailor.</p> <p>The Washington Post also reported a Navy source saying that one of the Marines killed in the attack might have been carrying a 9mm Glock and might have also returned fire.</p> <p>The attack caused citizens around the country to take up armed post outside of military centers to defend service members who by law are not allowed to carry their own firearms. The Pentagon later asked people to stop doing this because it could adversely impact our mission, and potentially create unintended security risks.</p> <p>Secretary of Defense Ash Carter reminded the military service chiefs Thursday that Defense Department policy does allow some military personnel to be armed while working at recruiting centers and ROTC offices.</p> <p>Carter directed the military branches Thursday to review security policies  including adding armed personnel  in the wake of the July shooting.</p> <p>American flags, signs and other remembrances are gathered at the Lee Highway memorial on July 29, 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. According to reports, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, 24, opened fire on the military recruiting station on July 16 at a strip mall and then drove to a Navy operational support center, killing four United States Marines and wounding a Navy sailor who died two days later. (Rick Diamond/Getty Images)</p> <p>Carter said in a memorandum released Thursday that the service secretaries should develop plans that include the option of armed personnel. Military personnel are generally prohibited from carrying firearms at recruitment centers and bases, but he reminded the chiefs that existing policy allows for armed personnel for security, law enforcement and counterintelligence duties.</p> <p>Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the memo is focused on facilities outside of military bases, such as recruiting stations and ROTC offices. He said there are about 7,000 such facilities throughout the United States.</p> <p>Looking at arming personnel doesnt mean thats what the services will ultimately decide, Davis said. But it does tell them that they have, within DOD policy anyway, the existing authority to do that.</p> <p>Davis acknowledged that the service chiefs will have to deal with potential conflicts at private buildings or on university campuses that restrict firearms.</p> <p>Im sure that the service chiefs, as they look at this, will be well aware of the constraints that they face in doing this, and that will be part of their plans, Davis said.</p> <p>(H/T: Al.com)</p> <p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.This story has been updated to include more information.</p>","http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/08/03/navy-responds-to-reports-sailor-will-be-charged-for-returning-fire-against-chattanooga-shooter/ "

# crowdsourcing-class

I took a class called Human Crowdsourcing and Computation in Spring 2016 that exposed me to gathering large amounts of data, cleaning it up, training classifiers (in this case, a rule-based one), and then modeling it via APIs like Google Charts. The platforms we used were Amazon Mechanical Turk and Crowdflower, and we used libraries like scikit-learn and other APIs like Alchemy. My team's final project crowdsourced information from people across the globe to classify the different physical and social characteristics that are desirable in a partner. We analyzed this via metrics like our participants' country of origin, age, and gender that we surveyed for in our online HIT.
